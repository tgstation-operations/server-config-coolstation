<h2>COOLSERVER RULES</h2>
yeah we got rules, many of them are common sense<br>
check the rules on our wiki for a bigger list with further deetz and a more thorough explanation.<br>
chemck em out:<br>
<b>http://wiki.coolstation.space/Rules</b><br><br>
<font color="red"><b>THIS IS A QUICK REFERENCE. LAWS ARE ARBITRARY. CRIME RULES. IF YOU WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE JUST ASK IF ITS COOL OK.</b></font><br>
<ol>
<li>THJIS IS AN 18+ SERVER u gotta be a legal adult because this is just a weird game not 4 kidz </li>
<li>party time. everyone's here to party, and sometimes parties get pooped a little. however there's a difference between ~a little spice~ and just ruining things for others OR being a fuck'n' creep, keep it in mind </li>
<li>Roleplay is cool as shit and very encouraged but not mandatory. Please consider at least a modest amount to keep things interesting! Talk to people. Make friends. </li>
<li>This game relies on trickery and sneakiness, so don't cheat by using multiple accounts or by coordinating with other players through out-of-game communication means. </li>
<li>OOC (Out of Character) chat is strictly for things that aren't taking place in the current, active round. This restriction begins when the round begins, and ends when the round ends. </li>
<li>We're not cops but we do have to keep this place in good shape. If admins ask you what's up with a thing you did we're generally looking for context and explanations, not excuses for why you think you should not be banned or excuses for why we think you should be banned. It's often a dispute and mediation deal. </li>
<li>If someone's bein' a chud or ruining shit, use the ADMINHELP command or F1 key if OFFICIAL ACTION may be needed. MENTORHELP is for assistance and advice. </li>
<li>if ur important to the station and/or the game's round (like AI or captain or a traitor, NOT like clown or staff assistant or rancher) please ahelp like, hey, i gotta go. a heads up so a replacement might be picked </li>
<li>while THJIS IS AN 18+ SERVER it must also be strongly emphasiszed that there is absolutely NO PORNO SEX, PLEASURE ERPS, OR YIFF YAFFING </li>
</ol>
The rules list is not the be-all and end-all. Admin discretion will be exercised.<br>
if u got feedback or suggestions or want to appeal a ban, behold our amazing fourm:<br>
